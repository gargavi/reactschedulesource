This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose 

The purpose of this was mostly to experiment in React, but the functionality is for a college student to calcualte their GPA easily, both in their major and overall. Mostly other online calculators don't provide this functionality so I thought it might be a helpful addition. 


If you want to see the full application, it is avaliable at: https://www.college-gpa.com
